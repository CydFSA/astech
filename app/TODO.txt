TODO for Astech:
----------------

* Enable savegame load on server status page.

Megamek supports loading savegames by a command line parameter:
java -jar MegaMek.jar -dedicated -port 2346 -password 'secret' [savegame]
I still cannot do it right. For now there is an option to use
MegaMek chat command /load to load savegame.


* (maybe) Merge map, save and unit templates.
They're nearly identical. Every minor change for one of those
is simply multiplied by 3. It won't be a nice template anymore
with all those new conditions I'll have to make, but will be easier
to catch bugs.
