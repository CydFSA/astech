TODO for Astech:
----------------

* Enable savegame load on server status page.
Megamek supports loading savegames by a command line parameter:
java -jar MegaMek.jar -dedicated -port 2346 -password 'secret' [savegame]
I still cannot do it right. For now there is an option to use
MegaMek chat command /load to load savegame.


* (maybe) Merge map, save and unit templates.
They're nearly identical. Every minor change for one of those
is simply multiplied by 3. It won't be a nice template anymore
with all those new conditions I'll have to make, but will be easier
to catch bugs.


* Enable https on entire page.
Bottle dev server handles the page well, but I need encryption.
I'll have to create nginx and apache configuration files.


* Encrypted password.
Yes. DONE


* Use SQLite for static files and game info.
It will be usefull to have logs of previous games.
Everytime Astech is looking for static files, it runs os.listdir. it would
be more secure to place those files in the database and not to scan directories.


* Remove MegaMek "fork" from Astech.
Astech uses it's own - unmodified - MegaMek 0.43.2. I'll figure out how to
easly download (and maybe update) MegaMek by the user.
WORK IN PROGRESS

* Improve GitHub wiki.
A little more documentation woudn't hurt. 


* Create docker image.
Secure installation is a time consuming process: create user, scp all files,
untar, copy service file, open firewall ports, etc... Docker could handle that.
DOCKER WILL BE DIFFICULT, BUT INSTALLATION GOT EASIER LATELY
