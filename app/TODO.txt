TODO for Astech:
----------------

* Enable savegame load on server status page.
Megamek supports loading savegames by a command line parameter:
java -jar MegaMek.jar -dedicated -port 2346 -password 'secret' [savegame]
I still cannot do it right. For now there is an option to use
MegaMek chat command /load to load savegame.


* Enable https on entire page.
Bottle dev server handles the page well, but I need encryption.
I'll have to create nginx and apache configuration files.

* Remove MegaMek "fork" from Astech.
Astech uses it's own - unmodified - MegaMek 0.43.2. I'll figure out how to
easly download (and maybe update) MegaMek by the user.
WORK IN PROGRESS

* Improve GitHub wiki.
A little more documentation woudn't hurt.
